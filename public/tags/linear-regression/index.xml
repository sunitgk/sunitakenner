      <description>“We would like to increase our revenue, so can we raise the price of Product”X&amp;quot;&amp;quot;? A question I’m often asked during Financial &amp;amp; Forecasting Fiscal Year Planning cycles. Using pricing as one of the levers to maximize revenue or profit margins is one of the challenging decisions businesses have to make. For offerings already in the market, how does a business determine if the pricing is right or optimal without the guesswork or intuition?</description>

      <description>Teaching R to 5th graders-Middle Schoolers during the weekend has been both enlightening and humbling.
Enlightening because kids understand data with context far better than adults; perhaps because they are not encumbered by the Big Data noise and always prefer visualization over text. I’ve learned to work within the limits of their attention span (so lots of breaks) and interest, cultivating a continuous learning environment versus a competitive one, a “We” versus an “I” approach, and “humbleness” in place “arrogance”.</description>
