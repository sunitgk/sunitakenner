      <description>“How likely are you to recommend”Company A&amp;quot; to a friend?&amp;quot; is an Net Promoter Score (NPS) question (Likelihood to Recommend/LTR) which categorizes the responses(voice of the customers) under 3 camps:
  Customers LTR_Score    Promoters 9 or 10  Passives 7 or 8  Detractors 0 to 6    A customer loyalty metric introduced by Fred Reicheld, Founder of Bain &amp;amp; Company’s Loyalty Practice, the Net Promoter Score (NPS) is used at my work as a compass by business decision makers to understand if NPS provides an insight to what drives customers to repeat purchase, referrals, and resistance to competitor offerings.</description>
