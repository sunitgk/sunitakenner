I'm a Data Scientist with a business focus and a background in Computer Science and Computational Finance.  This blog is about using R/Python in solving Business problems, providing Cotons' Insights (Coming soon!!), and teaching 5th-Middle Schoolers.  I enjoy wrangling insights from the customer asset-base, and enable decision-making that maximizes the return on [**Data P&L**](http://www.cybaea.net/Journal/2017/08/04/Towards-Data-Value-Management/). R/Python are my favorite tools for wrangling, analyzing and presenting the end-analysis product as interactive apps (shiny applications). 

This blog is created using **Hugo Future Imperfect** designed by [Julio Pescador](https://github.com/jpescador). Thanks Julio for this fantastic blog-tool!!
