<p>The objective of this post is to document how to successfully connect to an SQL database from RStudioIDE user. Follow instructions at <a href="https://db.rstudio.com/getting-started/connect-to-database/">rstudio Connect to database</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1. brew install freetds:  &quot;--with-unixodbc has depreciated, not needed&quot;
2. brew install psqlodbc
3. brew install mysql
4. brew install sqliteodbc
5. Find odbcinst.ini
sudo find / -name odbcinst.ini (should be in usr/local/etc/)
nano /usr/local/etc/odbcinst.ini

6. Add the following &amp; save

[PostgreSQL Driver]
Driver          = /usr/local/lib/psqlodbcw.so

[SQLite Driver]
Driver          = /usr/local/lib/libsqlite3odbc.dylib

[ODBC for FreeTDS]
Driver          = /usr/local/lib/libtdsodbc.so

7. Find odbc.ini
sudo find / -name odbc.ini (should be in usr/local/etc/)

nano /usr/local/etc/odbc.ini

8. Add the following &amp; save

[PostgreSQL]
Driver              = PostgreSQL Driver
Database            = test_db
Servername          = localhost
UserName            = postgres
Password            = password
Port                = 5432

[SQLite]
Driver          = SQLite Driver
Database=/tmp/testing

[ODBC for FreeTDS]
Driver              = ODBC for FreeTDS
Database            = RPT_DWH
Servername          = SQL-RPT.extensis.com
UserName            = ro
Password            = Extensis9
Port                = 1433

9. In R, run the console command to check if drivers are installed. . .
odbcListDrivers()

10. run the console command 
install.packages(&quot;odbc&quot;)

6. Add the following &amp; save

[PostgreSQL Driver]
Driver          = /usr/local/lib/psqlodbcw.so

[SQLite Driver]
Driver          = /usr/local/lib/libsqlite3odbc.dylib

[ODBC for FreeTDS]
Driver          = /usr/local/lib/libtdsodbc.so

7. Find odbc.ini
sudo find / -name odbc.ini (should be in usr/local/etc/)

nano /usr/local/etc/odbc.ini

8. Add the following &amp; save

[PostgreSQL]
Driver              = PostgreSQL Driver
Database            = test_db
Servername          = localhost
UserName            = postgres
Password            = password
Port                = 5432

[SQLite]
Driver          = SQLite Driver
Database=/tmp/testing

[ODBC for FreeTDS]
Driver              = ODBC for FreeTDS
Database            = RPT_DWH
Servername          = SQL-RPT.extensis.com
UserName            = ro
Password            = Extensis9
Port                = 1433

9. In R, run the console command to check if drivers are installed. . .
odbcListDrivers()

10. run the console command 
install.packages(&quot;odbc&quot;)</code></pre>
