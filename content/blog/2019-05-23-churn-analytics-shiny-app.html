<p>I had fun building the <a href="https://busaanalytics.shinyapps.io/Blog_ProductChurn_App/">Churn Analytics shinymaterial application</a> by using <a href="https://ericrayanderson.github.io/shinymaterial/">Eric Andersenâ€™s</a> shinymaterial package. This is a fantastic package(Thank you Eric) that enables shiny developers like me implement Material Design using R code; more about it <a href="https://rviews.rstudio.com/2018/03/13/alternative-design-for-shiny/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The app is a final product of the Churn analysis project at work, and as always a great learning experience!!</p>
