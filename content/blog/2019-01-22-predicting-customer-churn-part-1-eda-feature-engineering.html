<p>This is Part 1 of a 3 Part series of predicting Customer Churn. Part 1 focuses on feature engineering, with the objective of deriving features that best represent drivers of churn.</p>
<p>Once the selected raw data is preprocessed, my first step towards the analysis starts with understanding how to frame data features with customers in mind; specifically, how can I transform data such that I am able to answer, say, what purchase/non-purchase customer behavior patterns tell their churn/no-churn story? Quantifying customer purchase behavior patterns, is one of the approaches that answers the question, and <a href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/introduction-to-automated-feature-engineering-using-deep-feature-synthesis-dfs-3feb69a7c00b">feature engineering</a> produces the quantification parameters to output 2 useful products:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Product 1: Quantitative Segmentation of our customers: Who are they?</li>
<li>Product 2: Context-based Features to feed/help our predictive model: Which customers based on those features are likely to churn?</li>
</ol>
<p>The output of the Analysis is available as an incremental shiny app <a href="https://busaanalytics.shinyapps.io/Blog_ProductChurn_App1/">here</a></p>

<h3>2 notable feature engineering quotes.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data – Dr. Jason Brownlee</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge. ‘Applied machine learning’ is basically feature engineering — Andrew Ng</p>

<h3>Part 1: Feature Engineering</h3>
<p>Key Objective: Simplicity and Maintainability. Build Features that can be understood by the targeted human audience and best represents the problem to the predictive model.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Start with feature selection to extract a relevant subset of the raw dataset. While correlation or other feature selection methods can be applied for feature selection, my first filter to selecting features are the Subject Matter Experts in the organisation(e.g. Product Owners/Sales) as the domain knowledge they contribute is one of the best filters for reducing noise in the data.</li>

<p>Let’s take a look at the example of a relevant subset of raw data using skimr.</p>

<li>Transform date-time variable to date-time with context features. For example, the date-time variable <code>Cal.Month</code> can be used to engineer the month a customer purchased the product, the monthly cohort/s those particular customers belong to, and the tenure of the customers. Businesses usually look to gaining transaction/churn insights on a monthly, quarterly, yearly, and <code>Fiscal year</code>(Fiscal Year in this example starts in July), so we can feature engineer those as well.</li>

<li>Our target is to predict customers who will churn. The dataset does not come preloaded with churn information. So how do we determine if a customer has churned? In this particular example, a customer churns if they do not renew their service annually, or if they have passed the <code>Maint End Date</code> variable without renewing. So, we engineer the churn feature setting a churn_check_flag, and using the max function on the variable <code>Maint End Date</code>. If a <code>Maint End Date</code> is not available, engineer feature/features that will help determine which customers have churned. For example, if the customer has not purchased more than once in 365 days, then the customer has churned.</li>

This requires date-time numeric calculation of <code>Cal.Month</code> and <code>time1</code> provided.
