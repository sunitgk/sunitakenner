The [shinymaterial app](https://busaanalytics.shinyapps.io/Blog_ProductChurn_App1/) built using [Eric Andersen's](https://ericrayanderson.github.io/shinymaterial/) shinymaterial package is an example of one of the Predictive Churn Analytics projects at  work. This is a fantastic package(Thank you Eric) that enables shiny developers like me implement Material Design using R code; more about it [here](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2018/03/13/alternative-design-for-shiny/). 

There are various online resources that detail solving binary classification problems such as Churn, but the one key resource that maximized my learning and application to a real-world product/s churn problem at work is [Matt Dancho's 10-weeks ROI-Driven Advanced ML Data Science course DS4B 201-R](https://university.business-science.io/p/hr201-using-machine-learning-h2o-lime-to-predict-employee-turnover).

As a sole analytics person that manages the entire data-science workflow, I need a high impact tool-box, given resource, budget and time constraints. Matt Dancho's Advanced ML course course provides that tool-box (examples: H2o automl algorithms + LIME which provides 30+ models in minutes + explainability that drives business insights, skimr for EDA), and the agile Business Science Problem Framework that provides a roadmap for data science project success.

Building the Churn predictive analytics shinymaterial application was fun and I look forward to building more in future. Check out [Matt Dancho's shiny app course](https://www.business-science.io/university/2019/05/16/course-launch-shiny-web-application-level-1.html).

I've included code chunks as examples of actual UI/server pieces of the app.
