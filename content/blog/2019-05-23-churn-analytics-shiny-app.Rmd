I had fun building the [Churn Analytics shinymaterial application](https://busaanalytics.shinyapps.io/Blog_ProductChurn_App/) by using [Eric Andersen's](https://ericrayanderson.github.io/shinymaterial/) shinymaterial package. This is a fantastic package(Thank you Eric) that enables shiny developers like me implement Material Design using R code; more about it [here](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2018/03/13/alternative-design-for-shiny/). 

The app is a final product of the Churn analysis project at work, and as always a great learning experience!!
